# Unipilot Roadmap 🗺️

Our vision is to become the **ultimate AI academic co-pilot**.
This document outlines our journey beyond the MVP.

## 🟢 Phase 1: The Foundation (Current)

**Goal:** Remove the friction of scheduling and note-taking.

- [x] **Smart Calendar**: AI Syllabus parsing & scheduling.
- [x] **Guardian Auth**: Secure, crash-proof login.
- [ ] **AI Lesson Notes**: Live transcription & summarization (In Progress).

## 🟡 Phase 2: The Tutor (Next)

**Vision:** Turn passive notes into active learning.

- **Socratic AI Tutor**: Chat with your notes. Ask "Quiz me on this lecture."
- **Flashcard Generator**: Auto-generate Spaced Repetition cards from parsed notes.
- **Assignment Tracker**: Extract due dates from syllabus and create a deadline countdown.

## 🔴 Phase 3: The Campus (Future)

**Vision:** Social learning and gamification.

- **Study Groups**: Share schedules and find common free blocks for group work.
- **Lecture Sharing**: Share superior notes with classmates.
- **Gamification**: "Focus Streaks" and badges for consistent study habits.

## 🧪 Research Findings & "The Why"

Why are we building this?

1.  **Fragmentation**: Students use 5 different apps (Canvas, GCal, Notes, Quizlet). We unify them.
2.  **Admin Fatigue**: organizing study takes more time than studying. We automate the admin.
3.  **Goldfish Attention**: Long lectures are hard to retain. AI transcription catches what humans miss.
